          Planets form using 3 things. Dust, Gravity and Gas. Dust is a very
          small pieces of dry dirt, sand, etc. in the form of a powder. Gas is a
          a substance like air that is not a solid or a liquid.To understand
          gravity, imagine the space is a huge grid. When we introduce an object
          to it, it bends the grid. That is because, it has mass!! Mass is the
          amount of stuff an object is made from.The more mass the object has,
          the more it bends space! When we place an object with less mass
          nearby,it moves towards objects with more mass!! That's gravity!!
          First there is a cloud of dust and gas. When there is enough dust and
          gas to bend space in the center of the cloud,that causes gravity to
          kick in! And that gravity will make most of the particles to form to
          the center. When that happens, the particles get bigger. The collapse
          causes all of them to smash into each other and form clumps! The
          collisions release energy which causes heat! Eventually, the center of
          the cloud gets so hot, it forms a star!

          After a star is formed, there is still some huge dust and gas
          particles which is left floating around get to become planets!!
          <br />
          As dust clumps move around the star, they smash into each other and
          grow more massive! After some time those clumps form into
          planetisemels. Planetisemels form when there is gravity enoought, to
          make them round! But their just the building blocks of a planet. Then
          they form protoplanets. Their like baby planets! When a bunch of
          protoplanets hit each other, they form a planet!!

          Most astronomers believe the Universe began in a Big Bang about 14
          billion years ago. At that time, the entire Universe was inside a
          bubble that was thousands of times smaller than a pinhead. It was
          hotter and denser than anything we can imagine. Then it suddenly
          exploded. The Universe that we know was born. Time, space and matter
          all began with the Big Bang. In a fraction of a second, the Universe
          grew from smaller than a single atom to bigger than a galaxy. And it
          kept on growing at a fantastic rate. It is still expanding today. As
          the Universe expanded and cooled, energy changed into particles of
          matter and antimatter. These two opposite types of particles largely
          destroyed each other. But some matter survived. More stable particles
          called protons and neutrons started to form when the Universe was one
          second old. Over the next three minutes, the temperature dropped below
          1 billion degrees Celsius. It was now cool enough for the protons and
          neutrons to come together, forming hydrogen and helium nuclei. After
          300 000 years, the Universe had cooled to about 3000 degrees. Atomic
          nuclei could finally capture electrons to form atoms. The Universe
          filled with clouds of hydrogen and helium gas.

        <h1>Black holes</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <img class="blah" src="https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2003/04/a_black_hole_and_companion_star_with_supernova2/17902678-2-eng-GB/A_black_hole_and_companion_star_with_supernova.jpg" alt="">
       <br><br>
        <p>
          Black holes are the strangest objects in the Universe. A black hole
          does not have a surface, like a planet or star. Instead, it is a
          region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself. This
          catastrophic collapse results in a huge amount of mass being
          concentrated in an incredibly small area. The gravitational pull of
          this region is so great that nothing can escape – not even light.
          Although black holes cannot be seen, we know they exist from the way
          they affect nearby dust, stars and galaxies. Many of them are
          surrounded by discs of material. As the discs swirl around them like a
          whirlpool, they become extremely hot and give off X-rays. Black holes
          come in many different sizes. Many of them are only a few times more
          massive than the Sun. These 'stellar-mass' black holes form when a
          heavyweight star, about 10 times heavier than the Sun, ends its life
          in a supernova explosion. What is left of the star – still several
          solar masses - collapses into an area only a few kilometres across.
          Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have supermassive black holes
          at their centres. These may be millions or billions of times heavier
          than our Sun. Supermassive black holes also power active galaxies and
          ancient galaxies known as quasars. Quasars may be hundreds of times
          brighter than even the largest ordinary galaxies. Objects that fall
          into black holes are literally stretched to breaking point. An
          astronaut who ventured too close and was sucked into a black hole
          would be pulled apart by the overpowering gravity.
